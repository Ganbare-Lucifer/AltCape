 ------------ 1. How to insert ------------ 

The basic usage is pretty easy.
It's recommended to use a clean ROM to not have any crashes!

 --- 1.1 Non SA-1 ROM ---
1) Get a clean ROM and open it with LM.
2) Enable FastROM, this can be found under the Options menu.
3) Change the compression options to LC_LZ2 - Optimized for speed or LC_LZ3 - Better compression, this can be also found under the options menu
4) Expand the ROM over 3MB. This is just to store the graphics away from banks $10-$3F
5) Open powerup_defs.asm, you may want edit something from there.
6) Insert the included GFX files to your rom. Totally optional.
7) Download a/some powerups and follow the instructions inside to add them to your ROM.
8) Open asar and patch powerup.asm.
9) Done!

 --- 1.2 SA-1 ROM ---

1) Get a clean SA-1 ROM.
2) Expand the ROM over 3MB. This is just to store the graphics away from banks $10-$3F
3) Open powerup_defs.asm, you may want edit something from there.
4) Insert the included GFX files to your rom. Totally optional.
5) Download a/some powerups and follow the instructions inside to add them to your ROM.
6) Open asar and patch powerup.asm
7) Done!

Note about changing the default sprite numbers:
If you have plans to change it, you must open powerup_defs.asm and change this define:

!starting_slot			= $00		;Starting slot of your custom sprites.

They need to be consecutive due to how my version of the item box special patch works.

 ------------ 2. Modifying data ------------ 

You may be thiking: "where can I modify Mario palettes?" "how can I add more Mario gfx?"

Those questions are really easy to answer, just read carefully.

--- 2.1 Making/Editing Mario palettes ---
	
Changing palettes is a bit tedious since you need to build those values manually and convert the RGB value to the SNES value. At least Lunar Magic gives you the SNES value.

1) Open Lunar Magic.
2) Build/open your palette with the palette editor.
3) Open powerup_files folder, then powerup_misc_data folder and open palette.asm file
4) Search for MarioPalettes (or LuigiPalettes) in the file.
5) The 2-byte long values are the palette colors, to get this number go to the palette editor in LM.
6) In the palette editor, there is a text that says SNES RGB Value, write that number in the table and repeat until you are done.

Note: The palettes starts at color 86 and ends in color 8F!

 --- 2.2 Adding more player GFX --- 

To add more GFX, just follow this:

1) Decide if you will keep the same layout as GFX32 (main Mario GFX, mario.bin in this patch) or the other GFX layout (see any of the new GFX in powerups_files folder), this is important!
2) Open powerup_files/powerup_gfx.asm
3) Put this code somewhere in the file:

	%insert_gfx(filename,index)

This line will search a file in powerup_files/graphics folder with the filename stated in the "filename" space.
If your graphics file is named "luigi.bin" then just put this:

	%insert_gfx(luigi,index)

And it will search for "luigi.bin" inside the powerup_files/graphics folder.
Now it's time to change the "index" part. You need to put a single digit number in that part to get the graphics index that you will need for future references.
Index 0 is occupied by mario.bin that has the GFX32.bin data, so more if you want to insert more GFX, you should start after 1.

	%insert_gfx(luigi,1)

After doing this, go to powerup.asm and search this:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Prot area
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

	%protect_data(mario)

Add another %protect_data but with your new GFX filename, if we keep with the luigi.bin example, then it would be:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Prot area
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

	%protect_data(mario)
	%protect_data(luigi)

--- 2.3 Using a different player GFX on each powerup. ---

This task can be achieved really easy:

1) Go to powerup_files/powerup_misc_data folder and open gfx_index.asm
2) Put in the correct byte the GFX index that you used in powerup_gfx.asm

Example:

I want Luigi GFX on his small, big, caped and fiery form and my index is 1

	;luigi gfx
	db $01,$01,$01,$01,$00,$00,$00,$00		; powerups 0 - 7
	db $00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00,$00		; powerups 8 - F

 ------------ 3. Powerup downloads ------------ 

Powerups can be found on my release thread.

Thread: http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=79053

 ------------ 4. Gamemode fixes -------------

Gamemode.asm (comes with UberASM) is required for this and I include bugfixes here just because I don't want to hijack more spots in the ROM:

Make sure that you call powerup_defs.asm in gamemode code, just put at the top of the file:

	incsrc powerup_defs.asm

1) Overworld Mario graphics glitches:
Open gamemode_code.asm, search gamemode_B and use this code:

gamemode_B:
	LDA	#$00
	STA	!gfx_bypass_flag
	RTS	

2) Level Mario graphic glitches
Same as above, but go to gamemode_13 instead.

gamemode_13:
	LDA	#$00
	STA	!gfx_bypass_flag
	RTS	

3) Weird ground interaction on title screen
Go to gamemode_06 and put this code:

gamemode_06:
	LDA	#$00
	STA	!clipping_flag
	STA	!collision_flag
	RTS	

4) Title screen Mario's graphic glitches
Add this code to gamemode_06:

gamemode_06:
	LDA	#$00
	STA	!gfx_bypass_flag
	RTS	

If using the above code to fix the weird interaction, your code should be this:

gamemode_06:
	LDA	#$00
	STA	!clipping_flag
	STA	!collision_flag
	STA	!gfx_bypass_flag
	RTS	

 ------------ 5. Incompatibility list ------------ 

Well, the complete incompatibility list is... still unknown,
but there are some patches that I'm sure that they doesn't work with this patch:

Mario 8x8 DMAer (included in this patch)
32x32 Player
Manual Player Palette Uploader (included in this patch)
Mario ExGFX (included in this patch)

If you know about another patch that is incompatible let me know!

 ------------ 6. FAQ ------------ 

Q: This crashes my ROM >:(
A: Did you followed the instructions AND used a clean ROM? I suggest to re-read the How to insert section.

Q: I need asistance with your patch, pls
A: You can talk to me on IRC via query if you want, I won't respond if I'm busy or AFK. The best thing that you can do is posting in the released thread or PMing me.

Q: Does this works with DKC Status bar?
A: Yes, I modified that patch to be used with this patch, you can download it from my file bin in SMWC.

Q: Powerdown patch?
A: Get MarioFanGamer's patch

Download: http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=12748

Q: DynamicZ?
A: Read powerup_defs.asm and this:

Mario ExGFX, Custom player palettes and Mario 8x8 tiles DMAer features won't be available when using Dynamic Z, you will need to read Dynamic Z manual in order to have Custom player palettes and Mario ExGFX, however, Mario 8x8 tiles DMAer isn't integrated into Dynamic Z so you will have to ask anonimzwx for that feature if he hasn't added it yet.

Q: Projectiles doesn't interact with blocks :(
A: I know, that's why I included projectile_blocks.asm file and a section on this readme called Custom interactive blocks.

Have another question that isn't answered here?

Go to the release thread I'll answer it.
