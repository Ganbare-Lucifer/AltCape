# Dynamic Z notes
Mario ExGFX, Custom player palettes and Mario 8x8 tiles DMAer features won't be available when using Dynamic Z, you will need to read Dynamic Z manual in order to have Custom player palettes and Mario ExGFX, however, Mario 8x8 tiles DMAer isn't integrated into Dynamic Z so you will have to ask anonimzwx for that feature.
