	<b>5)Search !i_read_the_readme define in powerups_defs.asm and set it to 1.</b><br><br>
	<b>6) Use AddMusicK for the first time in your ROM.</b><br><br>
		&emsp;AddMusicK is required for some checks, weird sound effects may occur if you don't do this before applying this patch.<br><br>
	<b>7) Open asar.exe and insert powerup.asm</b><br><br>
	<b>8) Copy "powerup_defs.asm" and paste it in your PIXI folder.</b><br><br>

	<b>10) Copy the powerup_defs folder and paste it inside of the powerups_files folder you created in your PIXI folder</b><br><br>
		&emsp;Your PIXI folder should looks like this:
	<center><img src="./images/patching_06.png"></center><br><br>
	<center><img src="./images/patching_07.png"></center><br><br>
	<b>11) Insert the included sprites with PIXI</b><br><br>
	<b>12) Copy the highlighted files to your GPS folder</b><br><br>
	<b>13) Insert the included blocks with GPS</b><br><br>

	<h2><a id="Tweaks">Customizing the patch</a></h2><br>
		This whole section is dedicated to the settings inside powerup_defs.asm file.<br><br>
		
	<b>!enable_projectile_dma</b><br>
	&emsp;This feature is for these powerups that shoots projectiles at enemies. It uploads the graphics of the projectile to VRAM to the highlighted spots in the image.<br>
	&emsp;Setting this feature to 0 means that it's up to you to relocate the projectile GFX to some space that isn't used.<br><br>
	<center><img src="./images/patching_04.png"></center><br><br>
	<b>!projectile_dma_tile</b><br>
	&emsp;Which tiles are going to be used for the Projectile DMA feature. Top left corner.<br><br>
	<b>!dynamic_items</b><br>
	&emsp;Having a lot of powerups also means that you need a lot of powerup items! This is why this feature was created. You can have up to 64 different powerup items.<br>
	&emsp;It uses DMA to transfer the powerup item graphic to the yellow spots in the following image, the pink one is used for the item box.<br><br>
	<center><img src="./images/patching_05.png"></center><br><br>
	&emsp;The limits of this feature are that you can't use ExAnimation on the powerup items and only <b>TWO</b> powerups can be on screen at the same time.<br><br>
	<center><img src="./images/patching_03.gif"></center><br><br>
	<b>!starting_slot</b><br>
	&emsp;It refers to the first sprite slot used by the custom sprites. It should match the values used in the provided sprites.txt file.<br>
	&emsp;If they don't match, Bad Things will happen to your ROM. You have been warned.<br><br>
	<b>!clear_7E2000</b><br>
	&emsp;Clears the uncompressed Mario graphics that are stored on RAM. If you're using the Mode 7 Game Over Patch you may want to set to zero this.<br><br>
	<b>!better_powerdown</b><br>
	&emsp;Enable if using it, it will disable some code used to clear RAM when hit. That's handled by the Better Powerdown patch from MarioFanGamer.<br><br>
	
	<h3>SP1 & SP2 remap options</h3>
	In this section everything is explained with comments. Knowledge about sprite tiles and YXPPCCCT is required here. Search an adequate tutorial about these.<br><br>
	<h3>Other defines</h3>
	There are some stuff related to the item box, everything is commented for easier understanding. Should be very straight forward.<br><br>
