	<b>Description</b><br><br>
	A custom powerup that took Super Mario Bros. 3 boomerang bros. and some original concepts to make this happen.

The boomerangs are powerful and can be thrown further if Mario is moving.<br>
	<!--But there's more! The main attraction of this powerup is that it can retrieve items and gave them to Mario, even if there are walls between Mario and the boomerang!.<br>--><br>
